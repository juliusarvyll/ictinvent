# RBAC Implementation Guide

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Comprehensive Permission System** (86 Permissions)
Created granular permissions covering:
- Assets (8 permissions)
- Serial Numbers (6 permissions)
- Computers (6 permissions)
- Categories (4 permissions)
- Departments (6 permissions)
- Borrowings (15 permissions) ⭐
- Users (7 permissions)
- Dashboard & Analytics (4 permissions)
- Reports (4 permissions)
- Audit & Logs (3 permissions)
- System Settings (3 permissions)

### 2. **7 Predefined Roles**
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Admin**: Manage all resources except users/roles
- **IT Manager**: IT operations + borrowing approvals
- **IT Staff**: Day-to-day IT operations
- **Department Head**: Department management + approvals
- **Employee**: Basic user access
- **Auditor**: Read-only compliance access ⭐ NEW

### 3. **BorrowingPolicy** ⭐
Comprehensive policy with methods:
- `viewAny()` - List borrowings based on permissions
- `view()` - View specific borrowing
- `create()` - Create borrowing
- `createForOthers()` - Create on behalf of others
- `update()` - Update borrowing
- `delete()` - Delete borrowing
- `approve()` - Approve requests (department-based)
- `reject()` - Reject requests (department-based)
- `return()` - Process returns
- `viewHistory()` - View audit trail
- `export()` - Export data

### 4. **Controller Authorization** ⭐
All BorrowingController methods now use:
```php
$this->authorize('action', $borrowing);
```

### 5. **Smart Filtering**
Automatic data filtering based on permissions:
- `view all borrowings` → See everything
- `view department borrowings` → See department data
- `view own borrowings` → See only own data

### 6. **Super Admin Bypass**
Super Admin automatically bypasses all permission checks

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Reset and Seed Permissions
```bash
# Clear permission cache
php artisan permission:cache-reset

# Seed permissions and roles
php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder
```

### Step 2: Assign Roles to Users
```php
// In tinker or seeder
$user = User::find(1);
$user->assignRole('Admin');

// Or multiple roles
$user->assignRole(['Admin', 'IT Manager']);
```

### Step 3: Check Permissions in Code
```php
// In controllers
if (auth()->user()->can('create borrowings')) {
    // Allow action
}

// Using policy
$this->authorize('approve', $borrowing);

// In blade
@can('create borrowings')
    <button>Create</button>
@endcan
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. Department-Based Approval
Only users from the **origin department** (item owner) can approve/reject requests:
```php
public function approve(User $user, Borrowing $borrowing): bool
{
    return $user->department_id === $borrowing->origin_department_id;
}
```

### 2. Status-Based Actions
- Can only approve/reject **pending** requests
- Can only return **borrowed** items
- Can only edit own borrowings if **pending**

### 3. Ownership Checks
Users with `edit own borrowings` can only edit their own pending borrowings

### 4. Automatic Filtering
Data is automatically filtered based on user permissions - no manual checks needed

---

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Employee Borrows Item
```
1. Employee creates borrowing request
2. Status: "pending" (if cross-department)
3. Origin department head receives notification
4. Department head approves/rejects
5. If approved, status: "borrowed"
6. Employee returns item
7. Status: "returned"
```

### Use Case 2: IT Staff Manages Assets
```
1. IT Staff can create/view assets
2. Can edit own department assets only
3. Can process returns
4. Cannot approve borrowing requests
5. Can view department borrowings
```

### Use Case 3: Auditor Reviews
```
1. Auditor has read-only access
2. Can view all borrowings
3. Can view complete audit trail
4. Can export reports
5. Cannot create/edit/delete anything
```

## 📝 Adding New Permissions

### Step 1: Add to Seeder
```php
// In RolePermissionSeeder.php
$permissions = [
    // ... existing permissions
    'new permission name',
];
```

### Step 2: Assign to Roles
```php
$admin->givePermissionTo('new permission name');
```

### Step 3: Use in Controller
```php
$this->authorize('new permission name');
```

### Step 4: Reseed
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Clear cache
php artisan permission:cache-reset

# Check user permissions
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::find(1);
>>> $user->getAllPermissions();
>>> $user->getRoleNames();
```

### Policy Not Working
```bash
# Make sure policy is registered in AppServiceProvider
# Check if user has required permission
# Verify Super Admin bypass is working
```

### Testing Permissions
```php
// In tests
$user = User::factory()->create();
$user->givePermissionTo('create borrowings');
$this->actingAs($user);
```

5. 🔄 Add API middleware for route protection
6. 🔄 Create admin panel for role management
7. 🔄 Add permission audit logging
